## Welcome to Mem0 Platform

**Mem0 Platform is a fully managed memory layer for AI agents.** Add persistent, personalized memory to your AI applications in minutes - no infrastructure setup required.

### The Difference Mem0 Makes

**Before Mem0 - Every conversation starts from scratch**

```python
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "I'm traveling to SF next week"}
    ]
)
```

Without memory, every conversation is isolated. User preferences disappear between sessions, previous context is lost, and personalization becomes impossible. Your AI can't learn or adapt to individual users.

---

**With Mem0 - Context that persists and personalizes**

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize with memory
mem0 = MemoryClient(api_key="your-mem0-key")
openai_client = OpenAI()

# Store conversation context
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm traveling to SF next week"}]
mem0.add(messages, user_id="alex")

# Retrieve relevant memories for personalization
memories = mem0.search("travel plans", user_id="alex")
# Returns: Alex is traveling to SF, prefers vegetarian food, allergic to nuts
```

Now your AI remembers. Context persists across sessions, preferences are automatically recalled, and responses adapt to each user's history. All with sub-50ms latency that won't slow down your application.
